A simple weather API project that demonstrates the use of securing an application through the use of file management, api keys, and environment variables. 

The .gitignore and the .env file have been excluded from this project, which contained the WEATHER_API_KEY, PROGRAM_NAME, and ZIP_CODE. Excluding these files demonstrates secure application development, ensuring that all of the sensitive information stays on our computer and isn't able to be accessed by the public.
